Preseeded Karma

Our purpose is to work in the area of liberating people so that at least some of them could truly and soulfully do that what is meaningful to our society.

This value system of ours should help us bring to you products that help people to build upon their ideas.



Preseeded Dharma

While we walk the path of our karma to help (wo)mankind make progress towards liberating themselves from their no scientific beliefs of the god and universe so that they could do what they will.  Our purpose is also to ensure that the soul is not ignored any more. Our purpose is to understand and impart the awareness of the god's vibe.

Preseeded Sewa

Our purpose is to ensure that each life we touch on our journey to building our products gets truly served. This is the first purpose of our products, not it's monetary value.
